#### TASK: :page_with_curl:
 * **0. Walls !**
 * In this first part, you¬øll have to:
 * 1.	Create a window with SDL2
 * 2.	Use raycasting to draw walls on your window !
 * 3.	You don¬øt need to be able to rotate the camera during the execution in this part,
   	but you must provide a way to change the angle of the camera in your code to see
  	if it works after recompiling it.
 * 4.	The color of the walls must be different from the color of the ground/ceil
 * 5.	The map doesn¬øt need to be parsed from a file, but you must provide a way to modify
   	it in your code to see if it works after recompiling it. (e.g. using an array of
   	arrays of integers or characters).
 * **EXAMPLE:**

Project Name: The Maze Explorer :video_game::dart:
Tagline: ‚ÄúJourney into the Depths of Raycasting Adventures‚Äù DEMO
Team
üë®‚Äçüéìfabian philip: Lead Developer.Graphics and Textures Specialist, Project Manager,
Quality Assurance. :floppy_disk:
Roles
Fabian philip: Responsible for all aspects of the project, including raycasting, graphics, project management, and quality assurance. Technologies
| ‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî‚Äì | | Libraries, Languages, Platforms, Frameworks: | | SDL2 for graphics and window creation. | | C language for core programming. | | GitHub for version control and collaboration. | Technology Choices: SDL2 was chosen for its enhanced features and improved performance over SDL-1.2.
Trade-offs:
SDL2 offers better multi-platform support and improved functionality, justifying its selection. click here to know more about SDL2
Challenge Statement:
The  Maze Explorer aims to address the challenge of implementing a 3D maze exploration game using raycasting techniques. This project serves as a hands-on opportunity for me, to deepen the understanding of raycasting, graphics rendering, and game development.
Technical Risks:
Collision Handling: The potential risk of inaccurately handling player collisions with walls. A safeguard is to implement rigorous testing and iteration to fine-tune collision algorithms. Performance: The risk of performance issues on different hardware configurations. Alternative strategies involve optimising code and utilising performance profiling tools.
Non-technical Risks:
Project Scope: The risk of feature creep leading to delays. To mitigate this, a clear MVP will be defined, and additional features will be considered post-MVP. User Engagement: Ensuring the game is engaging. Strategies involve incorporating user feedback during development and testing phases.
Infrastructure
Process for branching and merging repository: This project is an individual effort, the branching and merging process will follow the GitHub Flow. Feature branches will be created for each task, and pull requests will be submitted for review and merging into the main branch. Strategy for deployment: Continuous integration will be implemented for automated testing. Deployment will involve pushing stable releases to GitHub, ensuring a versioned and accessible codebase.
How to populate the app with data:
Initial map data will be hardcoded, allowing for quick development and testing. Future iterations will include a parser to read map data from external files, enhancing flexibility. Tools, automation, or process to use for testing: Testing will include unit tests for individual functions, integration tests for overall functionality, and manual testing for user experience. Automation tools such as Unity for C will be employed for comprehensive testing.
Existing Solutions
Wolfenstein 3D, DOOM. Which Focus on 3D maze exploration, use of raycasting. The 3D Maze Explorer aims for educational purposes and hands-on learning, allowing for customization and unique features.
About
The project will not delve into complex multiplayer functionality or advanced AI enemies. While it focuses on providing an immersive 3D maze experience, it won‚Äôt cover every aspect of a full-fledged game development pipeline. However, this project will be beneficial for individuals interested in game development, particularly those keen on understanding raycasting and its application in creating visually engaging 3D environments. Users may include students, developers, and enthusiasts looking to explore the intricacies of maze exploration games.
NOTE: This project is not dependent on any specific locale. It is designed to be universally applicable and accessible to users worldwide.
